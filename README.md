# airport-info

## Description
This project helps calculate flight infomration for an airport throughout an entire year. For example, it can calulate the average number of flights departed, lowest number of flights in a day, etc. This program helped me learn more and practice passing information through functions and altering the infomration within the funciong.

## Features
The program utilitzes its own stuct in order to assign attributes to an airport. The program takes in user data and catagorizes the date to the appropriate storage in an array. Through the use of functions, the program uses the user info to calculate different averages and records. The functions are able to take in the arrays and the infomration stored inside of them in order to make their calculations.

## How to Use
In order to use the code for this project, download the zip file and open it. From there, upload the project and its contents to your local compiler. You can find a large variety of C compilers online to use.

## Technologies
The system used to create this app was a MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro has an 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 16 GB of memory.

## Collaborators 
I was able to accomplish this with the assistance of Pearson's Starting out with C++ sixth edition lab manual.
